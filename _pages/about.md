I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with Professor [David Z. Pan](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dpan/) in the [UTDA Lab](https://www.cerc.utexas.edu/utda/).

I completed my B.S. degree in Semiconductor Systems Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University, Republic of Korea, in 2018, and my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Computer Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin in May 2025 with Professor David Z. Pan.
